# PPRCODE_Guideline
A userguide of the PPRCODE server website
## Introduction
**PPRCODE** server is an approach to PPR code and target RNA sequence predition. It first identifies the PPR motifs in an submitted sequence by PScan algorithm provided by [ProSite](https://prosite.expasy.org/). By the discrepancies between traditional and structural definitions of **PPR motif** and **PPR CODE**, the analysis result is refined to improve the quality of motif detection. After the determination of PPR motif and PPR code, the RNA sequence targeted by the protein is then generated, providing a sequence reference to any researcher interested in the PPR protein with unknow function.

## Required information
**We only requires your protein sequence in FASTA format and your email address.** nothing more.
However, we would like to gather the sequences and requested results in order to the usage and i
